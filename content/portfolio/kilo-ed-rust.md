service: Terminal Based Text Editor
client: Rust, Cargo, Linux, Git

shortDescription: "Kilo-ed-rust is a **Rust-based text editor designed for terminal use** that was created entirely from scratch. Similar to other terminal-based editors such as Vim, it is based on the \"Build your own text editor in C\" article but adapted for Rust. The Github repository for kilo-ed-rust contains comprehensive instructions with code snippets in the Notes section for building the editor from the ground up."

challenge: " Building a text editor presents challenges such as designing a user-friendly interface, implementing **text editing features** like text buffer management, rendering text etc., optimizing performance, **handling files**, and testing and debugging. Using existing libraries or frameworks, prioritizing essential features, and gathering feedback from users can help overcome these challenges. In addition, the editor needs to support various operating systems and have a **customizable user experience.**"

solution: " Kilo-ed-rust is a text editor written in Rust that aims to be **small, fast, and easy** to understand. Key features include **syntax highlighting** for several programming languages, **incremental search**, undo/redo, clipboard support, and basic file handling. The editor supports both mouse and keyboard **navigation**, and users can customize keybindings to suit their preferences. Kilo-ed-rust is also **highly portable**, with minimal dependencies, and runs on multiple platforms, including Linux, macOS, and Windows."

Throughout the process of building this project, I have acquired numerous **technical skills**, including: a strong command of the **Rust programming language** and its syntax, expertise in low-level systems programming concepts such as **input/output handling**, and concurrency, the ability to design and implement efficient user interfaces for **text editing**, a sound understanding of **command-line interface (CLI) tools** and experience in text processing and manipulation techniques, including searching, replacing, and syntax highlighting.
