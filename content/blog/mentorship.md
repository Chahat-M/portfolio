When I first stepped foot into college, I felt a mix of excitement and uncertainty. Thankfully, I had the guidance and mentorship of two amazing seniors who had already graduated. In this blog, I want to share my personal experiences and how their mentorship profoundly impacted my life. From the challenges I faced to the valuable lessons I learned, I discovered the true value of having mentors and the importance of staying true to myself.

#### Seeking Initial Guidance: Finding Support in the Unknown

Starting college was overwhelming, with so many new things to navigate. Luckily, I found solace in the advice and support of my senior mentors. They were always there for me, patiently answering my questions and helping me with important decisions like managing my time and choosing the right projects. Their kindness and selflessness made a world of difference during those initial months.

#### Embracing Personal Agency: Shaping My Future

With newfound determination, I began to trust my own instincts and make decisions based on what felt right for me. It was liberating to take control of my own journey. I discovered my strengths, nurtured my interests, and started paving a path that was uniquely mine. Through this process, I grew as an individual and gained confidence in my own abilities.

#### The True Essence of Mentorship: Growing Independently

Looking back, I now understand that mentorship isn't about blindly following someone else's path. It's about having someone who believes in you and supports your personal growth. My mentors inspired me, provided guidance, and shared their wisdom, but they also encouraged me to find my own voice. True mentorship empowers us to become independent thinkers and creators of our own destinies.
