As a programming enthusiast pursuing electronics studies, I embarked on a unique academic journey where my passion for coding took center stage. While electronics formed the foundation of my studies, my true interest and dedication were directed towards programming. In this blog, I will share my personal experiences, emphasizing the significance of dedicating time to programming, seeking support from peers and seniors, and optimizing your learning experience in the field of electronics. By striking the right balance, you can ensure a solid foundation in both fields, unlocking limitless opportunities for your future career.

####  The Significance of Maintaining a Good CGPA while Nurturing Programming Passion

While programming may be your passion, excelling in your overall academic performance is crucial for several reasons:

- A good CGPA reflects your understanding of electronics concepts and ensures that you have a solid grasp of the fundamental principles.
- A higher CGPA can make you stand out among other candidates during job applications, demonstrating your ability to handle complex tasks and work diligently.
- If you have aspirations for higher education or research opportunities, a good CGPA opens doors to prestigious universities and scholarship programs.

Balancing CGPA and programming passion requires a strategic approach. The next section will let you know the strategy I followed to achieve a good CGPA alongwith nurturing my programming skills.

#### My Approach: Selecting Coding-Infused Projects and Collaborative Learning

Throughout my academic journey, I chose to prioritize my time and efforts in programming. While electronics was a requirement of my studies, programming was my true calling. I focused on sharpening my coding skills, exploring various programming languages and frameworks, and delving into software development projects that aligned with my interests.

I deliberately sought out course projects that allowed me to intertwine coding with electronics concepts, particularly in subjects like Communication, Digital Signal Processing, Embedded Systems. These projects not only bridged my passion for programming but also deepened my understanding of electronics by applying coding principles to real-world applications.

In subjects where coding was not directly applicable, like Digital and Analog Electronics, I proactively sought guidance from friends and seniors who had expertise in those areas. Their support and insights helped me navigate those projects efficiently while maximizing my time for coding practice.

#### Maximizing Learning through Active Classroom Engagement and Dedicated Practice

Attending classes with genuine interest and active participation has been instrumental in my learning journey. By immersing myself in lectures, asking questions, and seeking clarification from professors, I maximized my understanding of electronics concepts. This approach reduced the need for extensive revision during exams, providing more time to focus on honing my programming skills.

Outside the classroom, I devoted my energy to practicing coding questions and working on personal programming projects. This dedicated practice not only reinforced my coding abilities but also fueled my enthusiasm for creative problem-solving and continuous innovation. Witnessing my programming projects come to life became a driving force in my academic and personal growth.
